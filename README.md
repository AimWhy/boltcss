# ⚡️Bolt.css

Basic styles for HTML Elements. Providing a mostly-reasonable set of styles without classes.

Use it for simple static sites or as a starting point and add your own classes. This is not a complete solution with layout grids, components, utility classes, and the like.

## Features

- No layout support
- No CSS classes
- Tiny
- Dark and Light modes

## How and why I made this

I used the fantastic [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN and modified it as needed.

I created Bolt.css because I wanted to

1.  Pay homage to HTML
2.  Have an exercise to learn more of the lesser-known tags/elements
3.  Use it in other projects

## Installation

### Via CDN

Drop this right into your `<head>` to use it via a CDN

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/boltcss/bolt.min.css" integrity="sha384-PSzHklU0wT897cBMg+9qlTsh9O0FtnWnfHus5/jGskSj518OHHoQug4Z2cAKCfcV">`

You will automatically receive updates/refinements as they are added.

If you want to lock to a specific version you can do so by adding a version to the href like so:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/boltcss@0.4.0/bolt.min.css">`

### Via NPM

`npm i boltcss`

or

`yarn add boltcss`

### Manually

You can self-host or copy + paste the stylesheet into your project by grabbing [bolt.css](https://github.com/tbolt/boltcss/blob/master/bolt.css) directly.
