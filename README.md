# ⚡️Bolt.css

Basic styles for HTML Elements. Providing a mostly-reasonable set of styles without classes.

Use it for simple static sites or as a starting point and add your own classes. This is not a complete solution with layout grids, components, utility classes, and the like.

## Features

- No layout support
- No CSS classes
- Tiny
- Dark and Light modes

## How and why I made this

I used the fantastic [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN and modified it as needed.

I created Bolt.css because I wanted to

1.  Pay homage to HTML
2.  Have an exercise to learn more of the lesser-known tags/elements
3.  Use it in other projects

## How to use

Grab the [bolt.css](https://github.com/tbolt/boltcss/blob/master/bolt.css) stylesheet and add it manually to your app.

Alternatively, drop this right into your `<head>` to use it via CDN

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tbolt/boltcss/bolt.css">`
