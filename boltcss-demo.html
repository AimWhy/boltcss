    <h1>⚡️Bolt.css</h1>
    <p>
      Basic styles for HTML elements. Providing a mostly-reasonable set of styles without classes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Use it for simple static sites or as a starting point and add your own classes. Don't use it as a complete solution as this doesn't include complex components, form validation, modals, or layout grids.
    </p>
		
		<!-- <h2>Motivation</h2> 
		<p>Theres a couple main reasons I wanted this to exist. First and foremost is that I long for the days where anyone with a little curiosity and some gumption could publish to the web. This serves as an ode to simple HTML being published without all sorts of crazy CMSs and JavaScript frameworks. As well, the native HTML elements are fairly powerful in their own right. Simply give them some styling love and you have something extremely usable and performant out of the box.</p>
    <p>Creating something like this should almost be a rite of passage for any web developer. While HTML is the absolute core of the web, it's increasingly neglected in favor of JavaScript.</p> -->
      
    <h2>How I made this</h2>
    <p>I used the fantastic <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML Elements Reference</a> on MDN and modified as I saw fit.</p>
		
    <!-- Replace this with features / highlights -->
